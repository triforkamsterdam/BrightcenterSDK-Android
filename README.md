BrightcenterSDK-Android
=======================

In this repo you'll find the PHP-SDK for Brightcenter. In this file I'll describe how you can use the SDK.

###Download the project
First of all you need to download the project. You can either check it out with git or download the zip. The downloaded folder will actually consist 2 projects; BrightcenterSDK-Android and ActionBarSherlock.

###Use the SDK in your project
To include the Brightcenter SDK in your app you need to follow the following steps.

1. include the `BrightcenterSDK-Android` project as a module in your project.
2. include the `ActionBarSherlock` project as a module in your project.
3. In your project add an dependency on both `BrightcenterSDK-Android` and `ActionBarSherlock`
4. Add the android-support-v4.jar to your classpath. (The jar can be found in the 'actionbarsherlock/libs' folder.

You alsno need to add the following thins to your AndroidManifest.xml:
```xml
<activity android:name="nl.trifork.brightcenter.androidsdk.activities.LoginActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Holo.Light"/>

<activity android:name="nl.trifork.brightcenter.androidsdk.MainActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Holo.Light"/>

<activity android:name="nl.trifork.brightcenter.androidsdk.activities.PostResultActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme”/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>
```


To start the Brightcenter SDK use the following piece of code wherever you want to start the login sequence:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(this, LoginActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
```
You'll be guided to the login screen where a teacher can fill in his/her credentials.

To use the picked student you can put your code in the `StudentFragment` class in the `onListItemClick` method. It should look something like this:
```java
    @Override
    public void onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) {
        if(position != 0){
            vars.setSelectedStudent(selectedGroup.getBCStudents().get(position - 1));
            //place your own code below:
            
        }
    }
```

###How to use the selected student
In your code you can use the folowing code snippet to get the id of the student:
```java
GlobalVars vars = ((GlobalVars) getApplicationContext());
String studentId = vars.getSelectedStudent().getStudentId();
```

###How to retrieve results of a student
To retrieve results of a student you can use the following code:
```java
BCConnect connector = new BCConnect();
List<BCResult> results = connector.getResultsOfStudent(String studentId, String assessmentId, String username, String password);
```
The username and password can be retrieved by using GlobalVars again:
```java
String username = vars.getUsername();
String password = vars.getPassword();
```

###How to post a result of a student
To post a result of a student the following code can be used:
```java
connector.postResultOfStudent(BCResult result, String username, String password)
```
BCResult should contain the following variables:
`score` the score of the student
`studentId` the id of the student
`assessmentId` the id of the assessment
`questionId` the id of the question
`duration` the duration in seconds
`CompletionStatus` a completionStatus enum

###Notes
-when a student logs out all variables in GlobalVars are set to `null`

-if you have problems using the sdk you can create an issue on github or with the jira issue tracker on tst-brightcenter.trifork.nl
